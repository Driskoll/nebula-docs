# What is Backup Restore (Enterprise Edition)

Backup Restore (BR for short) Enterprise Edition is a Command-Line Interface (CLI) tool. With BR Enterprise Edition, you can back up and restore NebulaGraph data.

For the deployment of BR in K8s Operator, see [Backup and restore data using NebulaGraph Operator](../../k8s-operator/4.cluster-administration/4.6.backup-and-restore.md).

## Features

- Backups and restoration of NebulaGraph data with a single command:
  - Support full and incremental backups.
  - Support the restoration of a full backup.
  - Support restoration across NebulaGraph clusters.
- Cloud and on-premises backup and restoration:
  - Local disks (SSD or HDD). It is recommended to use local disks with the shared storage service NFS.
  - Cloud services compatible with the Amazon S3 interface, such as Alibaba Cloud OSS, MinIO, Ceph RGW, etc.
- Support to view the progress of backup or restoration.

## Limits

- The version of NebulaGraph Enterprise Edition clusters must be equal to or greater than v{{ nebula.release }}.
- Using BR Enterprise Edition in a container-based NebulaGraph cluster is not supported.
- After enabling zone, it's essential to ensure that the backup and restore clusters have the same node configuration; otherwise, it can lead to data restoration failures.
