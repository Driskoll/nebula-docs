# AppBase class

The AppBase class is the parent class of the custom algorithms provided by {{plato.name}}. You can develop custom algorithms based on it.

## Member functions

In the AppBase class, users need to implement the following member functions.

### name

Algorithm name. You need to specify the algorithm name when executing the algorithm. The algorithm name consists of letters, numbers or underscores.

### operatingMode

The operating mode. It consists of the following:

- `PUSH_PULL`: Iterative computation. For example, the WCC algorithm uses this operating mode.
- `VISIT_EDGE`: Access outgoing or incoming edges. For example, the GetNeighbors algorithm uses this operating mode.
- `ALL`: Includes both `PUSH_PULL` and `VISIT_EDGE` modes.

### compute

The core logic of the algorithm. It provides a `Graph &graph` object, which allows you to get the incoming and outgoing edges of a vertex, perform iterative computation, etc.
