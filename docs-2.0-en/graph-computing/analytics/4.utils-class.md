# Utils

Utils provides a series of utilities, including file output, data writing for {{nebula.name}}, timers, serialization, etc.

## Utilities

The FileWriter class can be used to output the results of an algorithm to a local file or an HDFS file.

The member functions of FileWriter are as follows:

- FileWriter (Constructor)

  Constructs a FileWriter instance.

  - Input:
    - `const std::string &outputDir`: The output path. It can be a local path or an HDFS path.
    - `int partitionId`: The current partition ID, which can be obtained by `graph.getClusterInfo().partitionId_`.
    - `bool compressed`: Whether to compress the result.
  - Return result: The `FileWriter` object.

- writeLine

  Outputs a line of text to a file.

  - Input:
    - `const std::string &line`: a line to be written to the file.

graph.getClusterInfo().partitionId_);

std::string line;

```
