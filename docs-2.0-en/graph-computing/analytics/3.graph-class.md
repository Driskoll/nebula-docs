# Graph class

The Graph class provides a series of methods to operate on the data structure of the graph, including fetching graph information, fetching vertex and edge information, performing iterative computation, etc. 

## Member functions

In the Graph class, users can implement the following member functions according to their business requirements.

### instance

Gets the instance of the `Graph` class.

- Input: none.
- Return result: The instance of the `Graph` class.

### getGraphInfo

Gets information about the graph space, such as scale, etc.

- Input: none.
- Return result: The `GraphInfo` object.
  
  The structure is as follows:

  ```c++
  struct GraphInfo {
    // true indicates a directed graph and false indicates an undirected graph.
    bool isDirected_;
    // The number of vertices in the current system.
    std::uint32_t vertices_;
    // The number of edges in the current system.
    std::uint64_t edges_;
    // The largest internal ID in the graph computation system. 
    // The graph computation system reassigns an internal ID to the vertex in the data source.
    std::uint32_t maxVid_;
  };
  ```

### getClusterInfo

Gets information about graph computation clusters.

- Input: none.
- Return result: The `ClusterInfo` object.
  
  The structure is as follows:

  ```c++
  struct ClusterInfo {
    // The number of partitions in the cluster of the graph computation system. Each partition starts a process to run the graph computation instance.
    int partitions_;
    // The maximum number of threads used by a process.
    int threads_;
    // Current partition ID.
    int partitionId_;
  };
  ```

### getVID

The graph computation system reassigns internal IDs to vertices in the data source. This function gets the internal ID in the graph computation system based on the vertex ID in the data source.

- Input:
  - `const std::variant<int64_t, std::string>`: The ID of the vertex in the data source. It may be of type string or int.
- Return result: 
  - `std::optional<InternalVID>`: The internal ID in the graph computation system.

### getVertex

Gets the vertex based on the internal ID in the graph computation system.

- Input:
  - `InternalVID`: The internal ID in the graph computation system.
- Return result: 
  - `std::optional<Vertex>`: The vertex object.

    The structure is as follows:

    ```c++
    class Vertex {
    public:
      InternalVID vid() const { return vid_; } // Gets the internal ID of the vertex.
    
      std::string tagName() const; // Gets the tag of the vertex.
    
      std::unordered_map<std::string, PropValue> properties() const; // Gets the properties of the vertex.
    
    };
    ```

### outEdges

Gets the outgoing edge based on the internal ID in the graph computation system.

- Input: 
  - `InternalVID`: The internal ID in the graph computation system.
- Return result: 
  - `EdgeIter`: The iterator of the edge.

    The structure is as follows:

    ```c++
    class EdgeIter {
    public:
      bool hasNext(); // Determines if there are other edges.
      Edge *next(); // Next edge.
    };
    
    class Edge {
    public:
      InternalVID src() const { return src_; } // Returns the starting vertex of the edge.
      InternalVID dst() const { return dst_; } // Returns the destination vertex of the edge.
      int64_t rank() const;                    // Returns the rank of the edge.
      std::string edgeName() const;            // Returns the type of the edge.
      std::unordered_map<std::string, PropValue> properties() const; // Returns the properties of the edge.
    };
    ```

### inEdges

Gets the incoming edge based on the internal ID in the graph computation system.

- Input: 
  - `InternalVID`: The internal ID in the graph computation system.
- Return result: 
  - `EdgeIter`: The iterator of the edge.

    The structure is as follows:

    ```c++
    class EdgeIter {
    public:
      bool hasNext(); // Determines if there are other edges.
      Edge *next(); // Next edge.
    };
    
    class Edge {
    public:
      InternalVID src() const { return src_; } // Returns the starting vertex of the edge.
      InternalVID dst() const { return dst_; } // Returns the destination vertex of the edge.
      int64_t rank() const;                    // Returns the rank of the edge.
      std::string edgeName() const;            // Returns the type of the edge.
      std::unordered_map<std::string, PropValue> properties() const; // Returns the properties of the edge.
    };
    ```

### foreachEdges

Performs an iterative computation of `pull` or `push` depending on the denseness of a graph.

If the ratio of the number of edges associated with the active vertices to the number of edges in the whole graph is greater than `1/20`, it is a dense graph and the system uses the `pull` operation. Otherwise, it is a sparse graph and the system uses the `push` operation.

- Input: 
  - `PushSignal<MSG>`: Sends a `push` operation message.
  - `PushSlot<MSG>`: Receives a `push` operation message.
  - `PullSignal<MSG>`: Sends a `pull` operation message.
  - `PullSlot<MSG>`: Receives a `pull` operation message.
  - `VertexBitmap`: Active vertex.
- Return result: 
  - `size_t`: The number of active vertices.

### push

Performs iterative computation by `push` only.

- Input: 
  - `PushSignal<MSG>`: Sends a `push` operation message.
  - `PushSlot<MSG>`: Receives a `push` operation message.
- Return result: 
  - `size_t`: The number of active vertices.

### pull

Performs iterative computation by `pull` only.

- Input: 
  - `PullSignal<MSG>`: Sends a `pull` operation message.
  - `PullSlot<MSG>`: Receives a `pull` operation message.
- Return result: 
  - `size_t`: The number of active vertices.

### broadcast

Broadcasts message data to all the partitions of the cluster of the graph computation system.

- Input: 
  - `VertexBitmap`: Active vertex.
  - `BroadcastSignal<MSG>`: Sends a broadcast.
  - `BroadcastSlot<MSG>`: Receives a broadcast.
- Return result: 
  - `size_t`: The number of broadcasts received.

### spread

Sends message data to a partition on a cluster of the graph computation system.

- Input: 
  - `VertexBitmap`: Active vertex.
  - `SpreadSignal<MSG>`: Performs a send operation.
  - `SpreadSlot<MSG>`: Performs a receive operation.
- Return result:

  - `std::function<void(const InternalVID &)>`: Executes this function for each vertex.
- Return result: none.

### foreachIsolatedVertex
