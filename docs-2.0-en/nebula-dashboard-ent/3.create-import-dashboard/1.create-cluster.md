# Create clusters

This topic introduces how to create clusters using Dashboard.

## Steps

You can create a cluster following these steps:

1. At the top of the Dashboard page, click the **Cluster Management** button.
2. On the **Cluster management** page, click **Create cluster**.
3. Enter a **Cluster Name**, up to 15 characters for each name.
4. Select the version of NebulaGraph to install.

    !!! note

      - If you are creating a cluster for the first time, or there is no required installation package here, you need to upload the package manually. For details, see [Package management](../system-settings/manage-package.md).

      - When creating a cluster with versions below 3.5.0, you need to upload the license certificate manually.

5. (Optional) Click the switch on the right of **Zone** to enable the zone feature for the cluster.

  !!! note

      - The zone feature is only supported in NebulaGraph 3.6.0 or later.
      - The zone is a logical rack for Storage nodes. The zone divides multiple Storage nodes into manageable logical zones to achieve resource isolation, while reducing traffic consumption and improving access efficiency by controlling Graph service access to replica data within a designated zone.
      - After you added nodes and services, the numbers of services enabled for your nodes are displayed in the zone.
      - You cannot turn the zone feature on or off after the cluster is created.
      - When creating a cluster, if you want to delete a zone, you need to make sure that there are no nodes in the zone. You cannot modify or delete a zone after the cluster is created.
      - It is recommended that the number of zones be set to an odd number to ensure that the leader can be elected. You cannot change the number of zones after the cluster is created.
      - For more information about the precautions and usages of zone in NebulaGraph, see [Manage Zones](../../4.deployment-and-installation/5.zone.md)ã€‚

  - You can set **Prioritize intra zone data reading**.
  - Click **Add Zone** and enter a zone name. You can add multiple zones.

6. Add node information by using either of the following ways:
   
  - **Add nodes**. Enter the following information: the Host, SSH port, SSH user, authentication type, NebulaGraph package, etc.

    The authentication type is described as follows:

    - SSH Password: Enter the password of the SSH user.

    - SSH Key: Click **Upload** and select the private key file of the node. You need to generate the secret key files on the node to be added and send the private key file to the current computer (not the machine where Dashboard is deployed). If the passphrase is set, this parameter is also required.

  - **Import nodes in batches**. The information of each node is required. To import nodes in batches, you need to choose the installation package and click **download the CSV template**. Fill in the template and upload it. Ensure that the node is correct, otherwise, upload failure may happen.

7. Select the node and add the service you need in the upper right corner. To create a cluster, you need to add 3 types of services to the node. If not familiar with the NebulaGraph architecture, click **Auto add service**.

8. (Optional) Edit the port and HTTP port of the meta, graph, and storage services, and then click **OK**.

9. (Optional) Click **Advanced Config** below to modify the service's runtime log store path, log detail level, HTTP service address, and data store path. You can also click **Add Config** to add your own service configuration.

10.  Click **Create Cluster**. Make sure the configuration is correct and there is no conflict between nodes, and then click **Confirm**.

11.  If a cluster with the status of `installing` appears in the list on the cluster management page, you need to wait for 3 to 10 minutes until the status changes to `healthy`, that is, the cluster is created successfully. If the service status is `unhealthy`, it means that there is an abnormal service in the cluster, click **Detail** for more information.

## Next to do

After the cluster is successfully created, you can operate on the cluster. For details, see [Cluster operations](../4.cluster-operator/operator/node.md).
