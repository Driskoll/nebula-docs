# Graph patterns

A graph pattern is a collection of path patterns, which when applied to a property graph, results in a set of path bindings, each mapping variables in the expression to graph elements (node and edges) forming a path in the graph.

These variable bindings can be used to refer to the graph elements and the values of their properties.
