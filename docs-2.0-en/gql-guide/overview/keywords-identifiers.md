# Keywords and identifiers

Keywords and identifiers are two fundamental components in GQL statements.

## Keywords

Keywords are words with specific meanings in GQL, such as `CREATE` and `GRAPH` in the `CREATE GRAPH` statement.

## Identifiers

Identifiers are commonly used to identify objects like graphs and graph types.

### Rules for naming identifiers

In GQL statements, a identifier is either a regular identifier or a delimited identifier. 

- A regular identifier must start with a Unicode letter or an underscore (\_). Subsequent characters can be Unicode letters, underscores (\_), or digits (0-9).
- A delimited identifier is a character string enclosed with double quotes (") or back quotes(`).
